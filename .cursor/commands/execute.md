# Execution Mode: Implement Task from Spec

You are a senior engineer implementing **one task at a time** from a specification. After each task, you MUST pause for human review before proceeding. This prevents the AI from going down unnecessary paths.

## Constraints
- Respect domain rules in `.cursor/rules`
- Implement **ONLY the current task** - do not jump ahead
- Make **minimal, focused changes** - no scope creep
- After each task: **STOP and wait for human approval**
- Update the spec file to check off completed tasks

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Review

Before writing any code:

1. **Read the Spec**
   - Load the spec file from `/spec/todo/`
   - Identify the current task to implement
   - Understand dependencies from previous tasks

2. **Gather Context**
   - Review files mentioned in the task
   - Search for existing patterns in the codebase
   - Identify all symbols/classes/methods you'll use
   - Verify signatures and existence of dependencies

3. **Plan the Change**
   - List specific files to modify
   - Describe the minimal change needed
   - Identify potential conflicts or issues
   - Note any assumptions

4. **Present Plan to Human**
   ```markdown
   ## Task [N]: [Task Description]
   
   ### Files to Modify
   - `path/to/file1.cs`: What will change
   - `path/to/file2.cs`: What will change
   
   ### Changes
   1. Change 1: Brief description
   2. Change 2: Brief description
   
   ### Assumptions
   - Assumption 1
   - Assumption 2
   
   ### Questions/Concerns
   - Question 1 (if any)
   - Concern 1 (if any)
   
   **Ready to proceed? (yes/no)**
   ```

### Phase 2: Implementation

Only proceed after human approval:

1. **Make the Changes**
   - Implement the minimal change for this task only
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include logging (without PHI)
   - Add code comments where needed

2. **Update Tests**
   - Update existing tests affected by changes
   - Add new tests if specified in the task
   - Use synthetic test data (follow testing-patterns.mdc)
   - Do NOT create new test files unless explicitly requested

3. **Self-Review**
   - Run `prompts/self_critique.rubric.md`
   - Check for PHI leaks in logs/errors
   - Verify consent checks if accessing clinical data
   - Confirm UTC usage for timestamps
   - Ensure error messages are user-friendly

### Phase 3: Handoff to Human

After implementation, present results:

```markdown
## Task [N] Complete: [Task Description]

### Changes Made
- `path/to/file1.cs`: 
  - Added method X
  - Modified method Y
- `path/to/file2.cs`:
  - Updated class Z

### Code Diff Summary
[Brief summary of key changes - not full diff]

### Tests Updated
- Test 1: What was updated
- Test 2: What was added

### Self-Critique Results
- [x] Spec/Intent alignment clear
- [x] Domain safety: PHI, consent scope, UTC
- [x] Minimality: smallest coherent patch
- [x] Readability: idiomatic style + docstrings
- [x] Side-effects: logging, errors, config

### Verification Steps
To verify this task:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Expected result

### Next Task Preview
Next task is: [Next Task Description]

**Please review the changes. Should I:**
- [ ] Proceed to next task
- [ ] Revise current task (please specify what to change)
- [ ] Pause for manual testing
```

### Phase 4: Update Spec

After human approval:

1. **Check off the task** in `/spec/todo/[spec-file]`
   - Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed task
   - Add completion timestamp if needed

2. **Move spec if all tasks complete**
   - If all tasks are done, move spec from `/spec/todo/` to `/spec/done/`
   - Update status in spec from "In Progress" to "Complete"

## Critical Rules

### DO
- ‚úÖ Implement ONE task at a time
- ‚úÖ STOP after each task for human review
- ‚úÖ Make minimal, focused changes
- ‚úÖ Update existing tests affected by changes
- ‚úÖ Follow existing code patterns
- ‚úÖ Check for PHI, consent, UTC compliance
- ‚úÖ Present clear handoff to human

### DO NOT
- ‚ùå Jump ahead to future tasks
- ‚ùå Make changes outside current task scope
- ‚ùå Create new test files unless explicitly requested
- ‚ùå Refactor unrelated code
- ‚ùå Add features not in the spec
- ‚ùå Continue without human approval
- ‚ùå Batch multiple tasks together

## Error Recovery

If you encounter issues:

1. **Stop immediately**
2. **Document the issue**:
   ```markdown
   ## Issue Encountered in Task [N]
   
   ### Problem
   [Description of the issue]
   
   ### What I Tried
   - Attempt 1: Result
   - Attempt 2: Result
   
   ### Possible Solutions
   1. Solution 1: Pros/Cons
   2. Solution 2: Pros/Cons
   
   ### Recommendation
   [Your recommended path forward]
   
   **Need human decision on how to proceed**
   ```
3. **Wait for human guidance**

## Example Task Execution

```markdown
## Task 3: Add consent validation to GetPatientRecords endpoint

### Pre-Implementation Plan

**Files to Modify:**
- `Controllers/PatientController.cs`: Add consent check
- `Services/ConsentService.cs`: Use existing ValidateConsent method

**Changes:**
1. Inject IConsentService into PatientController
2. Add consent validation before data access
3. Return 403 if consent invalid

**Assumptions:**
- ConsentService.ValidateConsent already exists
- Consent scope is "EHR_VIEW"

**Ready to proceed?** ‚è∏Ô∏è WAITING FOR HUMAN APPROVAL

---

[After approval]

### Implementation Complete

**Changes Made:**
- `Controllers/PatientController.cs`:
  - Injected IConsentService
  - Added consent check in GetPatientRecords
  - Return 403 Forbidden if consent invalid

**Tests Updated:**
- `PatientControllerTests.cs`:
  - Updated GetPatientRecords_ValidConsent_ReturnsOk
  - Updated GetPatientRecords_InvalidConsent_Returns403

**Self-Critique:** ‚úÖ All checks passed

**Verification:**
1. Run: `dotnet test --filter PatientControllerTests`
2. Expected: All tests pass

**Next Task:** Task 4: Add audit logging for consent checks

‚è∏Ô∏è WAITING FOR HUMAN REVIEW - Please approve before continuing
```

## Completion

When all tasks are done:

```markdown
## üéâ All Tasks Complete

**Spec**: [spec-file]
**Tasks Completed**: [total-tasks]
**Status**: Ready for final review

### Summary of Changes
- Component 1: Changes made
- Component 2: Changes made

### Testing Performed
- Unit tests: X passing
- Integration tests: Y passing

### Next Steps
1. Run full test suite
2. Manual testing (if needed)
3. Run `/verify-commit` to check for technical debt
4. Create PR/commit changes

**Spec moved to**: `/spec/done/[spec-file]`
```

## Usage

To use this command, specify which task to implement:

```
/execute Task 1 from /spec/todo/2024-01-15-feature-name.md
```

Or simply:

```
/execute Task 1 from [feature-name] spec
```

After completing a task and getting approval:

```
/execute next task

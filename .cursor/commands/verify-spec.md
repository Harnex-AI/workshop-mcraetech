# Verification Mode: Validate Specification

You are a technical reviewer validating a specification against the **current codebase context**. Your job is to find inconsistencies, conflicts, hallucinations, and missing considerations BEFORE implementation begins.

## Constraints
- Be thorough but constructive
- Focus on **preventing problems** not just finding them
- Provide specific, actionable feedback

## Verification Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Alignment Check

Verify the spec aligns with actual codebase:

1. **Component Existence**
   - [ ] All referenced files/classes/methods actually exist
   - [ ] File paths are correct
   - [ ] Namespaces/packages are accurate
   - [ ] Dependencies are available

2. **API Signatures**
   - [ ] Method signatures match what's in the spec
   - [ ] Parameter types are correct
   - [ ] Return types are accurate
   - [ ] No hallucinated methods or properties

3. **Integration Points**
   - [ ] Integration points actually exist
   - [ ] Interfaces match expected contracts
   - [ ] Data flow is feasible with current architecture
   - [ ] No missing intermediate components

4. **Dependencies**
   - [ ] All dependencies are installed/available
   - [ ] Versions are compatible
   - [ ] No circular dependencies created
   - [ ] External services are accessible

### Phase 2: Domain Rules Compliance

Check compliance with domain-specific rules:

1. **PHI Protection** (security-phi-protection.mdc)
   - [ ] No PHI in logs
   - [ ] No PHI in error messages
   - [ ] No PHI in URLs/query params
   - [ ] Proper PHI handling in all components
   - [ ] Test data is synthetic (testing-patterns.mdc)

2. **Consent Validation** (consent-validation.mdc)
   - [ ] Consent checks on clinical data access
   - [ ] Correct consent scopes used
   - [ ] Consent expiry validation included
   - [ ] Audit logging for consent usage
   - [ ] No hardcoded consent values

3. **UTC Temporal Rules** (temporal-utc-standard.mdc)
   - [ ] All timestamps stored in UTC
   - [ ] No LocalDateTime or ambiguous types
   - [ ] Timezone handling for user display
   - [ ] Database schema uses TIMESTAMPTZ

4. **Error Handling** (error-handling-production.mdc)
   - [ ] No stack traces to clients
   - [ ] User-friendly error messages
   - [ ] Correlation IDs for tracking
   - [ ] No internal details exposed
   - [ ] Proper HTTP status codes

### Phase 3: Architecture & Design Review

Evaluate architectural decisions:

1. **Consistency**
   - [ ] Follows existing patterns in codebase
   - [ ] Naming conventions match
   - [ ] Layer separation respected (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)
   - [ ] No architectural violations

2. **Completeness**
   - [ ] All necessary components identified
   - [ ] No missing error handling paths
   - [ ] Edge cases considered
   - [ ] Rollback plan is feasible

3. **Simplicity**
   - [ ] Not over-engineered
   - [ ] Simplest approach that works
   - [ ] No unnecessary abstractions
   - [ ] Clear and maintainable

4. **Security**
   - [ ] Authorization checks included
   - [ ] Input validation specified
   - [ ] SQL injection prevention
   - [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

### Phase 4: Task Breakdown Review

Validate implementation tasks:

1. **Task Quality**
   - [ ] Tasks are small enough (15-30 min each)
   - [ ] Each task is independently reviewable
   - [ ] Clear input/output for each task
   - [ ] Files listed for each task

2. **Task Ordering**
   - [ ] Dependencies ordered correctly
   - [ ] No circular task dependencies
   - [ ] Prerequisites come first
   - [ ] Logical progression

3. **Task Completeness**
   - [ ] All components covered by tasks
   - [ ] Testing tasks included
   - [ ] Documentation tasks (if needed)
   - [ ] No missing steps

### Phase 5: Risk Assessment

Identify risks not covered in spec:

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Performance implications
   - Scalability concerns
   - Data migration needs
   - Breaking changes to existing APIs

2. **Integration Risks**
   - Impact on existing features
   - Backward compatibility
   - Third-party service dependencies
   - Database schema changes

3. **Operational Risks**
   - Deployment complexity
   - Monitoring/alerting needs
   - Rollback complexity
   - Data loss potential

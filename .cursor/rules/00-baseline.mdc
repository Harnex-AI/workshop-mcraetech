# Baseline (Workshop 1)
- Use minimal, testable diffs and clear docstrings.
- Never invent APIs or clinical semantics; if unclear, output a **Questions** block first.
- Treat `/context/*` as authoritative; reference relevant items explicitly.
- Always run the **Selfâ€‘Critique** rubric before final output.
- Log model route + token estimates in `/ops/run-report.md`.

# Advanced Prompting Rules
- Structure prompts as: **Instruction → Constraints → Inputs → Steps → Self‑Critique**.
- Constraints must reference `/context/standards.md` and domain rules in `/context/product_domain.md`.
- Prefer "Minimal Change Patch" for fixes. Provide a unified diff and a short rollback plan.

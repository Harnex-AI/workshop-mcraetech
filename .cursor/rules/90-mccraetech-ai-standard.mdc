# McCraeTech AI Standard (Workshop 1)
## Domain Red Flags
- **PHI**: never log or include real patient data; use synthetic examples only.
- **Consent**: require `EHR_VIEW` scope when accessing clinical data; fail safe if absent.
- **UTC**: store/return timestamps as UTC; document conversions at boundaries.

## Coding Expectations
- **Java**: Spring idioms; thin Controller, thick Service; DTOs with Bean Validation; no entity leakage.
- **.NET**: ASP.NET Core; nullable enabled; input validation; `ProblemDetails` for errors.

## Process Expectations
- Use the **Enterprise Code** prompt pattern for changes.
- Choose model route deliberately; log runs; escalate when verification fails.
- Generate/update `SDK_README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` after meaningful changes.

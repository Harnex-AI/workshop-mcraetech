## üìö Context Management Patterns

### Progressive Context Loading
```
Phase 1 (Setup):        Rules only
Phase 2 (Implement):    + Source files (1-2 at a time)
Phase 3 (Debug):        + Terminal output
Phase 4 (Verify):       + Related files
Phase 5 (Document):     + All files
Phase 6 (Cleanup):      Remove source, keep docs
```

### Security-First Context (Healthcare)
```
Priority 1: security-phi-protection.mdc (FIRST!)
Priority 2: temporal-utc-standard.mdc (SECOND!)
Priority 3: consent-validation.mdc
Priority 4: Other domain rules
Priority 5: Source files
```

### Context Budget Management
```
Small Context (gemini-2.5-flash, grok-code-fast-1):
- 1-2 source files
- 1-2 rules
- Function/method focus

Medium Context (gemini-2.5-pro, grok-4):
- 3-5 source files
- All relevant rules
- Module-level focus

Large Context (claude-4.5-sonnet):
- Entire package
- All rules and docs
- Architecture-level focus
```

## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. Context is Code
Your rules, docs, and specs are as important as your source code. Treat them with the same care.

### 2. Progressive Loading
Add context as needed. Don't overload the AI with unnecessary information.

### 3. Security First
For healthcare projects, ALWAYS add security rules before any code changes.

### 4. Model Selection Matters
Use fast models for simple tasks, reasoning models for complex/critical ones.

### 5. Verification Pass
Always verify critical changes with a second model pass (preferably Claude Sonnet 3.5).

### 6. Track Decisions
Use Cursor notepads to maintain context across sessions and track important decisions.

## üö® Common Issues

### Build Failures

**Java:**
```bash
# Maven dependency issues
mvn clean install -U

# Java version issues
java -version  # Should be 17+
```

**C#:**
```bash
# NuGet package issues
dotnet restore --force
dotnet clean
dotnet build

# .NET version issues
dotnet --version  # Should be 8.0+
```

### Cursor Rules Not Applying
1. Check `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files exist
2. Verify glob patterns match your files
3. Add rules to Docs panel manually
4. Restart Cursor IDE

### AI Not Following Patterns
**Solution:** Add the specific rule to context explicitly
```
Example: "@.cursor/rules/security-phi-protection.mdc"
```

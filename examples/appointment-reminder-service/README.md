# Context Engineering Demo: Healthcare System

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This demo showcases effective context management strategies in Cursor IDE through a real-world healthcare system.

**The Setup:** A complete, working healthcare system with Patient management, Consent validation, and Audit logging already built and tested.

**The Demo:** Add Emergency Contact Notifications (15-20 min) using context engineering.

**The Exercise:** Attendees add Appointment Reminders (20-30 min) using the same approach.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

See [BASE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md](./BASE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md) for complete details on what's already built.

See [DEMO_FEATURE_SPEC.md](./DEMO_FEATURE_SPEC.md) for the demo script.

See [HANDS_ON_APPOINTMENT_REMINDERS.md](./HANDS_ON_APPOINTMENT_REMINDERS.md) for the hands-on exercise.

### Verify Everything Works
```bash
mvn clean test
mvn spring-boot:run
```

All tests should pass âœ… and server should start on http://localhost:8080

# How to Create Custom Cursor Commands

## What Are Cursor Commands?

Cursor commands are reusable prompts that you can invoke by typing `/` in the chat. They make it easy to execute common workflows without typing long prompts every time.

**Example**: Instead of typing "Create a specification for adding consent validation to patient endpoints", you can just type `/plan for adding consent validation`.

## When to Create a Command

Create a command when you:
- Have a workflow you repeat frequently
- Want to standardize how your team approaches a task
- Need to enforce specific patterns or constraints
- Want to make complex prompts easier to use

**Example Use Cases:**
- Code review checklists
- Security audits
- Feature setup workflows
- Bug fix procedures
- Documentation generation
- Test creation patterns

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Workflow

Ask yourself:
- What task do I (or my team) do repeatedly?
- What steps are involved in this task?
- What constraints or rules should be followed?
- What output should be produced?

**Example Workflows:**
- "Review code for security issues"
- "Set up a new feature branch with proper structure"
- "Create a pull request with all required information"
- "Run all tests and fix failures systematically"
- "Onboard a new developer to the project"

---

## Step 2: Create the Command File

### File Location

Commands go in `.cursor/commands/` directory:

```
.cursor/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-command-name.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ another-command.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### File Naming

- Use **lowercase with hyphens**: `code-review.md`, `setup-feature.md`
- The filename becomes the command: `/code-review`, `/setup-feature`
- Keep names short and memorable

---

## Step 3: Write the Command Content

Commands are written in **plain Markdown**. The content describes what the AI should do when the command is invoked.

### Basic Template

```markdown
# [Command Name]: [Brief Description]

[Detailed description of what this command does and when to use it]

## Constraints
- Constraint 1 (e.g., follow specific rules or standards)
- Constraint 2 (e.g., respect domain requirements)
- Constraint 3 (e.g., output format requirements)

## Steps

### 1) [First Step Name]
[Description of what to do in this step]
- Sub-step 1
- Sub-step 2

### 2) [Second Step Name]
[Description of what to do in this step]
- Sub-step 1
- Sub-step 2

### 3) [Third Step Name]
[Description of what to do in this step]

## Output Format

[Describe what the output should look like]

```markdown
[Example output format]
```

## Checklist

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Checklist item 1
- [ ] Checklist item 2
- [ ] Checklist item 3

## Next Steps

After completing this command:
1. Next action 1
2. Next action 2
```

---

## Step 4: Add Domain-Specific Context

Reference your domain rules and standards:

```markdown
## Constraints
- Follow `/context/standards.md` + `.cursor/rules/90-mccraetech-ai-standard.mdc`
- Respect domain rules in `/context/product_domain.md` (PHI, consent scope, UTC)
- Check for PHI exposure (security-phi-protection.mdc)
- Validate consent checks (consent-validation.mdc)
- Use UTC timestamps (temporal-utc-standard.mdc)
```

This ensures the AI follows your project's specific requirements.

---

## Step 5: Test Your Command

1. **Save the file** in `.cursor/commands/`
2. **Open Cursor chat** (Cmd+L or Ctrl+L)
3. **Type `/`** to see your command in the list
4. **Run the command** with test input
5. **Verify the output** matches your expectations
6. **Iterate** if needed

---

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ
- **Keep it focused**: One command = one clear purpose
- **Be specific**: Provide clear steps and constraints
- **Include examples**: Show expected output format
- **Reference standards**: Link to your domain rules
- **Add checklists**: Help ensure completeness
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the command works as expected

### DON'T ‚ùå
- **Make it too broad**: Avoid commands that try to do everything
- **Be vague**: Don't leave steps open to interpretation
- **Skip constraints**: Always include relevant rules and standards
- **Forget output format**: Always specify what should be produced
- **Ignore domain context**: Reference your project's specific requirements

---

## Advanced: Parameters and Context

Commands can accept additional context from the user:

```markdown
# Example Command

When the user types: `/my-command with additional context here`

Everything after the command name is included in the prompt.
You can reference this in your command instructions.
```

**Example**:
```
/review the authentication changes for security issues
```

The command receives: "the authentication changes for security issues"

---

## Sharing Commands with Your Team

### Project Commands (Recommended)
Commands in `.cursor/commands/` are automatically available to anyone who has the project open.

**Pros**:
- Version controlled with your code
- Easy to update and maintain
- Team members get updates automatically

### Team Commands (Enterprise/Team Plans)
Create commands in the [Cursor Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content&section=commands) for server-enforced commands.

**Pros**:
- Centrally managed
- Available across all projects
- Admin-controlled

---

## Troubleshooting

**Command doesn't appear in the list**
- Check the file is in `.cursor/commands/`
- Verify the file has `.md` extension
- Restart Cursor if needed

**Command doesn't work as expected**
- Review the command content for clarity
- Add more specific constraints
- Include examples of expected output
- Test with different inputs

**Command is too complex**
- Break it into multiple smaller commands
- Simplify the steps
- Remove unnecessary details
